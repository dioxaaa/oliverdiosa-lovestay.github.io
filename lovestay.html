                    <p>Stray Kids (Korean: 스트레이 키즈; RR: Seuteurei Kijeu; often abbreviated as SKZ) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2017 reality show of the same name. They debuted on March 25, 2018 with District 9. The group's name "Stray Kids" was not defined by JYP Entertainment but conceptualized by the members themselves. It originally referred to a lost child who wants to chase their dreams and later evolved to represent the idea of finding a way together out of the ordinary.</p>

        <h2 class="red-text text-darken-4">Bangchan</h2> 
        <p>Bang Chan is the leader (and oldest member) of Stray Kids, meaning he is the voice of the group and often takes control during interviews. He’s also one of the main rappers, a vocalist and producer of the group. The K-pop leader was born in South Korea, but grew up in Sydney, Australia, after moving there when he was very young — so he speaks both Korean and English. He’s a Libra, as he was born on October 3, 1997. He moved to South Korea to train as a K-pop star under JYP in 2011, and trained for 7 years. He’s known to be the most sociable of the group and has numerous K-pop star friends including GOT7’s Bambam and Yugyeum, most of the members of TWICE and BLACKPINK’s Lisa.</p>

        <p>Lee Know is the main dancer of the group, along with a vocalist and sometimes, a rapper. He was born in Gimpo, South Korea on October 25, 1998, making him a Scorpio. He and member Felix had the smallest amount of training at JYP, with just 1 year to get it together to debut! Fun fact: he was a backup dancer for BTS prior to being a JYP trainee — so the small training period makes sense.
            Another fun fact: he’s a cat person! He has three cats named Sooni, Doongi and Dori.</p>

He was born and raised in Sydney, Australia, until moving to South Korea to become a JYP trainee in 2017. Felix only had one year to train to become a K-pop star and learn Korean before debuting with Stray Kids in 2018.</p>
